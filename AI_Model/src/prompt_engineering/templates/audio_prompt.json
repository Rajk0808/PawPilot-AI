				"response": "**Audio Summary:** The clip contains repeated high-pitched barking with intermittent whining and short pauses, suggesting sustained arousal rather than casual alert barking.\n\n**Likely Emotional State:** Likely anxious/distressed (86% model confidence).\n\n**Key Vocal Indicators:**\n- High pitch and fast repetition can indicate stress\n- Whining between barks suggests unmet need or discomfort\n- Limited calm intervals indicate poor self-settling\n\n**Intensity and Confidence:** Intensity: 7/10. Confidence: Medium-High.\n\n**Recommended Next Actions:**\n1. Move your dog to a quieter space and reduce triggers (door/window noise, strangers, other dogs).\n2. Offer calm reassurance and a familiar enrichment item (lick mat, chew, snuffle activity).\n3. Track duration/frequency and note trigger patterns.\n\n**Escalation Guidance:** If this behavior is sudden, persistent, or paired with panting, pacing, or appetite changes, contact your veterinarian or a certified behavior professional for a full assessment."
