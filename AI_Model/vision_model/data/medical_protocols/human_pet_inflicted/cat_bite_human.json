    "full_protocol_text": "Cat bites carry an exceptionally high infection risk of 50-80%, the highest of all animal bites. This is due to Pasteurella multocida bacteria present in 70-90% of cat mouths, combined with the deep puncture wounds created by their needle-like teeth. These puncture wounds seal quickly on the surface but trap bacteria deep in tissue where infection develops rapidly, often within 12-24 hours. Immediate action is critical: Stop bleeding with gentle pressure for 5 minutes. Immediately wash the wound with soap and water for 5-10 minutes, but do not scrub vigorously as this can damage tissue. Rinse thoroughly under running water for 2-3 minutes. Apply antiseptic such as povidone-iodine or betadine. Cover with sterile gauze. Seek medical attention within 8 hours - prophylactic antibiotics (typically Amoxicillin-clavulanate) are almost always prescribed for cat bites due to the extremely high infection risk. Hand bites are especially dangerous due to tendons and joints. Assess rabies risk based on cat's vaccination status and behavior. Monitor wound for 14 days for signs of infection including redness, swelling, pus, fever, or red streaks. Any worsening symptoms require immediate medical attention."
