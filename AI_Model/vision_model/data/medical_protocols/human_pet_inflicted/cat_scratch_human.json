Immediate action: Wash scratch with soap and water for 5 minutes, rinse, apply antibiotic ointment, cover if needed. Most scratches heal without issue. Monitor for 7-21 days for CSD symptoms: swollen lymph nodes near scratch site, small red bump at scratch, fever, fatigue. Symptoms typically appear 7-14 days post-scratch. If symptoms develop, seek medical care - azithromycin may be prescribed. Most cases resolve in 2-4 months without treatment. Immunocompromised individuals at higher risk for severe complications. Prevent scratches: avoid play that provokes cats, trim cat nails, teach children gentle handling."
