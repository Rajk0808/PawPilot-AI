    "full_protocol_text": "Dog bites carry 15-20% infection risk. Bacteria include Pasteurella, Staph, Strep, and Capnocytophaga. Dog bites often cause crushing injuries with tissue damage. IMMEDIATE ACTION: If bleeding, apply firm pressure for 10-15 minutes. Wash wound thoroughly with soap and water for 15-20 minutes (longer than typical wounds). Rinse for 5 minutes. Apply antibiotic ointment, cover with sterile bandage, elevate if possible. SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION within 8-12 hours for deep punctures, crushing injuries, face/hand/foot bites, stray dogs, or wounds needing stitches. Antibiotics (Amoxicillin-clavulanate) often prescribed for high-risk bites. CRITICAL: Assess rabies risk - verify dog's vaccination, observe for 10 days if owned. Rabies PEP required if stray, unknown vaccination, abnormal behavior, or cannot observe. Monitor 14 days for infection signs: spreading redness, swelling, pus, fever, red streaks. Report to animal control. Face bites always require immediate care."
