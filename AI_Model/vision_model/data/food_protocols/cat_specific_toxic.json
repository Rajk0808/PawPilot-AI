True lilies (Lilium) and Daylilies (Hemerocallis) are most dangerous. Even small exposures like licking pollen off fur can be fatal. Symptoms begin within hours but kidney failure develops over 24-72 hours and is often fatal without immediate aggressive treatment. This is the deadliest common household plant for cats. NEVER have lilies in cat households."

Exposure can be topical, ingestion, or inhalation (from diffusers). Cats groom themselves and will ingest oils on fur. Even diffused oils can cause problems. Concentrated oils cause more severe toxicity including liver damage. Never use essential oils on cats or in diffusers in cat households without vet approval.  "
