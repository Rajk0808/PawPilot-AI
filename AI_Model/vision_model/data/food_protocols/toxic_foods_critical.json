Some dogs can be severely poisoned by just 3-5 grapes while others may tolerate more. Because it's impossible to predict which dog will be affected, ANY ingestion is an emergency.

Symptoms typically appear within 12 hours and include marked weakness (especially hind legs), tremors, vomiting, depression, and inability to walk.

Most dogs recover fully within 24-48 hours with supportive veterinary care including IV fluids and monitoring. Chocolate-covered macadamia nuts are doubly dangerous due to chocolate toxicity."
